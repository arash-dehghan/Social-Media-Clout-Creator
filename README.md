# Social-Media-Clout-Creator
This application helps to amass large numbers of following on social media. The application grabs the most popular current content on a specified subreddit, and automatically uploads it to your social media accounts on Instagram, Twitter, etc.

For example, if you have a Fortnite page, you can utilize the r/fortnitebr subreddit to take the most popular fortnite related videos and to automatically upload them onto your page. The program also stores information regarding each video in a CSV file, so that we can not only keep track of which videos we have already downloaded and posted, but also using the text information to include descriptions and credit for each video posted automatically.

Once enough videos have been downloaded and saved, the program automatically concatenates them and uploads them to YouTube, again including the appropriate descriptions and credit for each video.

This can also be done for photos and GIFs. 

To run these programs, you must setup varying API's which are specified in the files in each folder.
